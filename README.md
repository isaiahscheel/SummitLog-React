# SummitLog-React

I am in the process of remaking my capstone project in which we made a hiking app using Flutter.

In this remake I will be using React instead and making some design changes in both the aesthetic and the technical design.

## React

I will be using react because it seems to be the industry standard these days and will give me some good experience
https://reactjs.org/

## Firebase

I will be using Firebase still as a backend to authenticate users, store data, and more.
My big goal here is to use more functions with Firebase and use the node express tools more rather than using it all as is. Before with Firebsae, I used the bare minimum and didn't use the function tools at all. This time I am using the functions a lot more paired with Express Node.js to help with the requests. I am also using Postman to test my requests and making sure they work the way I am intending.

## Redux

React and Redux seem to go hand in hand so it will be beneficial to learn it as well.

## Mobile App

For my capstone we made this application in Flutter which is a cross-platform (ios and Android) mobile app framework. 
With this time being in React we are making it mostly for the web, or are we? There are a lot of tools to use to go from website to mobile app, so I have heard. Explained here, https://hackernoon.com/web-apps-turn-website-into-mobile-app-your-four-best-options-78fcb2277be8 are a few options.

### Web Based App
It can just be a website that is extremely optomized for mobile apps. The only problem I see with this is that with the mobile Flutter app we were able to keep the hikes lists offline. So if you were offline you could still see all the hikes that you have done and were going to do. You could even add a hike and it would be pushed to the database later.

### Apache Cordova Wrapper
This is a program that takes websites and makes them into mobile apps, can be a really good option as well
https://cordova.apache.org/

### Progressive Web Apps
This may be the same as the web based app but not too sure honestly, will have to look more into it.
https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/


### React-native
React-native is the mobile version of React and it compiles into the OS of your choice (I believe). However, how does it work with a React Website -> React Native mobile app. Not too sure, but it seems promising.

## SummitLog
So what is Summit Log? Summit Log is an application that hikers and adventure seekers store and share hikes they want to do and have done. We allow users to store pictures of those hikes, location, etc. We have an interactive map where we allow the user to look at all the hikes that they have done, and the hikes of people they follow.
